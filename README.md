# BeautyInBlack

A community dedicated to the beauties of black culture

## Focus

I got tired of black people being cast in a bad light. I've been around for over 50 years and I've seen so many beautiful parts of my black culture. I decided it was time to create a community dedicated to recording black culture.

This is not anything to do with being a threat to any other race or community, this is about reminding our youth of the culture of creativity, love, compassion, and strength.

## Community

We welcome people of all creeds, colors, religion, gender. The one thing we will not tolorate is anything that adds to the demise of black culture. Drill music and gang culture is a trap that is feeding the industial prison complex and we plan to starve that system.

# Get Involved

I can't do this by myself, The code base is writen using ASP.NET Core. The front end is using Blazor. Get involved and do a pull request with a feature that makes sense.
